# DNF Commands

### Description:
- This script configures and creates commands for managing packages in Fedora using DNF.
- It creates the `update`, `upgrade`, `search`, `install`, and `remove` files in the **~/.bin** directory and adds the `~/.bin` directory to the executable search path ($PATH) in the **.bashrc** file.

### Usage:
1. Run this script in a terminal using the command: `./dnf_commands.sh`
2. After running the script, you can use the created commands (update, upgrade, search, install, remove) in the terminal.
3. The commands can be run directly from the terminal without specifying the path to the `~/.bin` directory.
